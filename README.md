# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning 



## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising
expenditure across different platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
Machine learning is used to analyze the relationship between advertising
spend and sales performance.

## Dataset
- File name: `Advertising.csv`
- The dataset contains advertising budgets and corresponding sales data.

### Features Used
- TV Advertising Spend
- Radio Advertising Spend
- Newspaper Advertising Spend

### Target Variable
- Sales

## Machine Learning Algorithm
- **Linear Regression**

Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between advertising
expenditure and product sales.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Selected relevant features
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated the model using regression metrics
6. Visualized actual vs predicted sales

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Conclusion
The model successfully predicts sales based on advertising spend and
demonstrates how data-driven approaches can support marketing decisions.
